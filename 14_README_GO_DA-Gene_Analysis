# 14. Gene Ontology differentially accessible marker gene analysis. 


## 14_GO_Analysis_2024-08-01.R
- getMarkerFeatures, groupBy Cluster, cutOff = "FDR <= 0.1 & abs(Log2FC) >=0.5"
- Calls top marker genes in each cluster.
- cc.go run for Gene Ontology results by cluster
- cc.gos run for simplified Gene Ontology results by cluster

## 14_GO_Barplot.R
- Reads in pairwise comparison results by cluster. 
- enrichGO used to create GO plots, file name ex: C3_T1vsT3_top20.png
## 14_GO_Barplot_2.R
- Uses same code as 14_GO_Barplot.R but includes results

## 14_C18-Subset_GO_Barplot.R
- Reads in pairwise comparison results by C18 subclusters. 
- enrichGO used to create GO plots, file name ex: C18.5_T124v3_top20.png

## 14_GO_Plots2.R
- topGOdata performs GO analysis
    - Runs enrichment analysis with Fisher's exact test
    - Summarizes results and extracts top GO terms
    - creates barplots and dotplots
- goseq performs GO analysis
    - Summarizes top GO terms; creates barplots and dotplots
- getBM performs GO analysis
    - Summarizes top GO terms; creates barplots. 
- Creates custom dotplots. 
## 14_GO_Plots_Loop.R
- Uses combined code from 14_GO_Plots2.R
- Loops through pairwise comparisons by cluster and treatment group.
