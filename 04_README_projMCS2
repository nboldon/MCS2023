# projMCS2_MarkerGenes.R
# Group by: Cluster (no subset), FDR <= 0.01, Log2FC >= 1.25
- getMarkerFeatures
- Marker list by cluster (FDR & Log2FC)
- Heatmaps for marker features; cowplots for all genes
# NOTE: projMCS2_MarkerGenes.R did not calculate abs(Log2FC)

# projMCS5_MarkerGenes.R 
# Group by: Cluster (no subset), FDR <= 0.01, abs(Log2FC) >= 1.25
- Files saved for each cluster; ex: C1_MarkerGenes_2025-03-06.csv

# Summary files created from analysis results of projMCS2_MarkerGenes.R
- 04_Cluster_Analysis_2024-02-12.xlsm
    - Each tab summarizes cell count information by cluster, including:
      - cell counts by sample and cluster (incl. median TSS & nFrags per cell)
      - normalized cell abundance percentages by sample (cells in cluster by sample divided by total cells in  sample; incl. total cell counts by sample)
      - normalized cell abundance by treatment group (incl. total cell counts by cluster and treatment group)
      - cell counts by cluster and genotype
      - cell counts by cluster and sequencing lane
      - cell counts by PCR plate (library preparation day)
- 04_GeneMarkers_byCluster_1-31-2024.xlsx
  - Includes cell type-specific marker gene notes from literature reviews in tabs 1 & 2
  - There is a tab for each cluster that highlights:
    - the top 50 marker genes, based on FDR 
    - cell type-specific marker genes found in literature reviews
  - There are two additional tabs for C1, C3, C8, C18, and C21 that highlight:
    - One tab specifies the Panther GO family, molecular function, biological process, cellular component, protein class, and pathways affected by specified genes. 
    - The other tab displays seperate bargraphs for Panther GO categories associated with molecular function, biological process, cellular component, protein class, and pathways affected by specified genes.

    - Summarizes key points of interest from the above analysis
