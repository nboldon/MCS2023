## 10. Marker genes subset by cluster, grouped by treatment


10_projMCS5_markerList_byCluster-Tx.R
- Creates heatmap & z-scores for 4 treatment groups using all sig genes found in C18, subset by C18
- Generates file: 07_C18_All127_byTx_zscores_2024-03-13.csv


10_projMCS5_GeneMarkers_TxComp-byCluster_Heatmap.R
- Subsets by cluster
- Uses marker genes known to be significant for the cluster of interest
- Creates z-scores and heatmaps by treatment
- File names ex: C4_byTx_zscores_2024-03-21.csv & C4_TxComp_Heatmap_2024-03-21.pdf
10_projMCS5_C1_Sorted_Heatmap.R
- First sorted heatmaps created
10_projMCS7_GeneMarkers_byCluster-TxGrp_2024-10-17.R
- Upgrades from previous 2 code records include sorted heatmaps in 1 file
10_projMCS5_GeneMarkers_byClusterTxComp_Loop_2024-10-17.R
- Subsets by cluster, group by treatment; loop for all clusters

10_projMCS6_GeneMarkers_TxComp-byCluster_2024-06-26.R
- Adds Harmony, subsets by cluster, groupBy treatment, uses MAGIC
- cutOff = "FDR <= 0.1 & abs(Log2FC) >=0.5
- Ex. file name: C25_TxComp_FDR-0-1_Log2FC-0-5_2024-06-26.csv
- Subset by cluster, group by sample: all returns were NULL
- Uses top 200 marker genes to create heatmaps & z-scores 
- Heatmap cutOff = "FDR <= 1 & Log2FC >=0.01"
- Ex. file names saved: C4_TxComp_Heatmap_2024-03-21.pdf & C4_byTx_zscores_2024-03-21.csv
