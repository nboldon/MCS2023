- Samples were first subset by cluster, then grouped by cell type for downstream analysis.


## 11_projMCS7_GeneMarkers_byCellType-TxGrp_2025-01-16.R

- Similar code to projMCS7_GeneMarkers_byCluster-TxGrp_2025-01-16.R but focuses on cell type groups
- Files ex: astro_GeneMarker_List_2025-01-16.csv


## 11_CellType_TxComps.R

- Code did not produce meaningful results
